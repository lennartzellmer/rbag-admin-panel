# Project Agents.md Guide for OpenAI Codex

This Agents.md file provides comprehensive guidance for OpenAI Codex and other AI agents working with this codebase.

## Project Structure for OpenAI Codex Navigation

This project follows the standard Nuxt 4 project structure.

- `/server`: A nitro server scructure with [file based routing](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/guide/directory-structure/server)
- `/server/eventDriven/*/businessLogic`: Holds the Command side of the API. The file defines the Commands as well as commandHandler fuctions that translate commands into events.
- `/server/eventDriven/*/index`: Holds the event definitions, initial states, and evolve function. as well as projection definitions and their helper functions. The file covers the entire "event-side" of the API.

## API Structure

The app's API is built with a CQRS pattern in mind. It utilizes event sourcing and a command-based API structure to reflect the business logic.

/**
* Finds multiple projections in the event store based on the provided filter and optional projection query.
*/
```
